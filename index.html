        <p>The colour tone he chose for his personalised Purosangue is called Verde Dora – Dora Green – and is in fact the colour
        of the 400 Superamerica that belonged to his father, Enzo. A particularly unusual colour, it clearly left itself
        impressed upon his teenage memory, although he has little memory of the car itself. Indeed, owned and driven by Enzo
        Ferrari between 1961 and 1962, the car does have a rather mysterious story.</p>

            <h2>FERRARI TAILOR MADE 812 COMPETIZIONE</h2>
            <p>At an exclusive event held at Casa Ferrari during Monterey Car Week and broadcast via live streaming, the
            Maranello-based company unveiled a one-of-a-kind Ferrari 812 Competizione. Without precedent, this Tailor Made car was
            inspired by the concept of a blank sheet, which is how the Ferrari Styling Centre starts its creative research for every
            new model.</p>
